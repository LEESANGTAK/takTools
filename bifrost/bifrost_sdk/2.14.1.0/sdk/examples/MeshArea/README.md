# Description
This example focuses on accessing (reading) Bifrost mesh face data.

The surface area of an input Bifrost mesh is computed by summing-up the area of each face.

Bifrost offset arrays are used to loop through the faces.

The Bifrost Geometry section of Bifrost's on-line [Developer Help section](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BIFROST/ENU) provides more details about the Bifrost Geometry data structure.

# Building the example with CMake
Directions on how to build this example can be found in the [sdk/examples/README.md file](../README.md) of your Bifrost installation.
